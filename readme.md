## Matrices as Linear Maps

This project talks about how matrices can be seen as transformation functions. This is very powerful and used in many important concepts in macnine learning. 

## Powerful Eigenvectors

This project talks about how eigenvectors characterize matrices. This is very powerful and used in many important concepts in macnine learning.
