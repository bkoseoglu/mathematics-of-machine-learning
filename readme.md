## Matrices as Linear Maps

This project talks about how matrices can be seen as transformation functions. This is very powerful and used in many important concepts in macnine learning. 

## Powerful Eigenvectors

This project talks about how eigenvectors characterize matrices. This is very powerful and used in many important concepts in macnine learning.

## Limitations of Summary Statistics

This project talks limitations of summary statistics and how it can be tricky when it comes to describing probability distributions.

## Maximum Likelihood estimation

This project talks about maximum likelihood estimation for parameters of various models. It also provides a practical example, a GaussianClassifier which predicts customer churn.
